# By-Laws of the Young Amateurs Radio Club

## 1. Organization.
The name of this organization is the Young Amateurs Radio Club. It is organized as a non-profit amateur radio club within the meaning of section 501(c)(7) of The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(7)) and section 5 of part 97 of the FCC Regulations supporting The Communications Act of 1934 (47 C.F.R. 97.5(d)(2)). However, no filing before the Internal Revenue Service for non-profit status shall be necessary as long as the organization does not maintain a treasury of its own.

## 2. Membership.
Full membership is open to licensed amateurs in good standing as well as to those with an interest in Amateur Radio. Applications for membership shall be submitted at regular meetings and at any time using the internet.

## 3. Governing Board.
The organization shall be governed by a Board of Directors. This Board shall be comprised of the club's FCC callsign trustee, any and all equipment (repeater) trustees, and a sufficient number of directors, of equal number or one less, but not less than 3, to maintain an odd count of directorships (at present, the directors are President, Vice President, and Treasurer, as well as a fourth Executive Director to maintain an odd number of members on the board). Each position on the Board shall have one vote (excluding the Vice President, who makes the final decision for the break of a tied vote, such as in the US Senate.). A member cannot be elected to more than one position. The trusteeship positions are not elected positions. However, with the acquisition of organization-owned equipment, or should a trusteeship become vacant without a successor named, the Board may appoint any member of the organization to that trusteeship position.

## 4. Election Procedure.
Only members of the Young Amateurs Radio Club board of directors shall be eligible to vote. Each member shall be able to cast as many votes as there are elected positions to fill. Election to the Board shall occur for the candidate receiving the largest plurality of votes and continue to the next largest plurality until all positions are filled. Should there be a tie vote for any position where there are more candidates than elected positions remaining, the membership will vote again, considering only those candidates and with each member casting a number of votes equal to the number of positions remaining. Should there be an equal or lesser number of candidates seeking election to the Board, they shall be considered elected without an election having taken place. There are no term limits imposed on any elected position. As such, a member (excluding the President and Vice President) shall hold their board position unless impeached by unanimous vote of the other board members, or until said member steps down from their position.
## 5. Dues.
The Board of Directors may set the necessary [annual] membership dues, which may not be increased by more than 25% of its current level without consent of a majority of the membership. The initial dues amount shall be zero, and any dues shall be collected in U.S. dollars.
## 6. Equipment and Property.
Unless purchased with funds from the organization's treasury, all equipment used by the organization remains the property of the respective trustee. No rights shall affix to the equipment by virtue of its use by the organization or its members nor shall the ownership rights of the trustee be diminished. All equipment purchased by the organization itself, from its treasury, remain property of the organization and likewise, no right of ownership attaches to such by the appointed trustee (or his successor).
## 7. Ratification.
The constitution and bylaws are hereby ratified on twelfth (12th) of March, in the year of two-thousand eighteen (2018), with the initial directors of the organization being:

*David F. Mosden **KD2OAH***, President, Executive Director  
*Scott W. Stelloh **KD2LWH***, Vice President, Executive Director  
*Caleb Smith **KZ0P***, Treasurer, Executive Director

# By-Laws of the Young Amateurs Radio Club

## 1. Organization.
The name of this organization is the Young Amateurs Radio Club. It is organized as a non-profit amateur radio club within the meaning of section 501(c)(7) of The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(7)) and section 5 of part 97 of the FCC Regulations supporting The Communications Act of 1934 (47 C.F.R. 97.5(d)(2)). However, no filing before the Internal Revenue Service for non-profit status shall be necessary as long as the organization does not maintain a treasury of its own.

## 2. Membership.
Full membership is open to licensed amateurs in good standing as well as to those with an interest in Amateur Radio. Applications for membership shall be submitted at regular meetings and at any time using the internet, and will be reviewed and accepted or denied by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may terminate an individual’s membership at their own discretion at any time by a majority vote. Individuals have the right to request that their membership to the club be terminated at any time.

## 3. Executive Board of Governing Directors.
Each of the three Officer positions holds a singular position on the Executive Board (i.e. a Member of the Board). The Trustee of the Club may be elected into an Executive Board position, however the title of Trustee does not carry with it a position on the Executive Board. The Executive Board votes on various matters regarding the club, as outlined in the Constitution and By-laws; each position on the Board shall have one vote. A Board member cannot be elected to or hold more than one position.

## 4. Election Procedure.
Only members of the Board of Directors shall be eligible to vote. Elections can only be held by majority decision of the Board of Directors. Each member shall be able to cast as many votes as there are elected positions to fill, but only one vote per candidate. Election to the Board shall occur for the candidate receiving the largest plurality of votes and continue to the next largest plurality until all positions are filled. Should there be a tie vote for any position where there are more candidates than elected positions remaining, the Board will vote again, considering only those candidates and with each member casting a number of votes equal to the number of positions remaining. Should there be an equal or lesser number of candidates seeking election to the Board than vacancies, the Board of Directors can choose by majority vote to either consider those candidate[s] elected without an election having taken place, or to cancel the election. There are no term limits imposed on any elected position. As such, a Board member shall hold their position unless impeached by unanimous vote of the other voting Board members, or until said member steps down from their position.

## 5. Dues.
The Board of Directors may set the necessary annual membership dues, which may not be increased by more than 25% of its current level without consent of a majority of the responding voting club membership. At the time of ratification of these Bylaws, there are no dues collected by the club. Should dues be collected, it will be in USD.

## 6. Equipment and Property.
Unless purchased with funds from the organization's treasury, all equipment used by the organization remains the property of the respective Trustee. No rights shall affix to the equipment by virtue of its use by the organization or its members nor shall the ownership rights of the Trustee be diminished. All equipment purchased by the organization itself, from its treasury, remain property of the organization and likewise, no right of ownership attaches to such by the appointed Trustee (or their successor).
